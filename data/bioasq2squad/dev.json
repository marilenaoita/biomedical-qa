17 were typed in 16 british and five south african families with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1).\ninspection of recombinant events in families informative for several markers suggests that the nf1 gene is located between the markers ew301 (cen-p11.2) and ew206 (cen-q12) and possibly distal to phhh202 (q11.2-q12).\nthe gene for von recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) has recently been mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17.\nin addition to reporting, in accompanying papers, their individual analyses of mapping the neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) gene on chromosome 17, members of the international consortium for nf1 linkage contributed their data for our joint analysis to determine the exact sequence of flanking markers and to obtain precise estimates and confidence limits of the recombination fractions for the closest markers, in anticipation of clinical use.\nto better map the location of the von recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (nf1) gene, we have characterized a somatic cell hybrid designated 7ae-11. this microcell-mediated, chromosome-transfer construct harbors a centromeric segment and a neo-marked segment from the distal long arm of human chromosome 17.\nthe cosmids in the nf1 region will be an important resource for testing dna blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme digests from nf1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients' dna and to identify the 17;22 nf1 translocation breakpoint.\nthe frequent loh surrounding the nf1 locus and lack of neurofibromin expression in these tumors suggest that nf1 gene mutations may contribute to the development of adrenal gland neoplasms in patients with nf1.\nin the latter, the breakpoint in 17q occurred below the centromere and is at or in the region of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) gene.\nneurofibromatosis type i (nf1) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutations in the long arm of chromosome 17, and characterised by neurofibromas, caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and axillary freckling.\nin addition, the mother's and maternal grandmother's genetic analysis showed identical mutations in the neurofibromatosis i gene on the long arm of chromosome 17, confirming the diagnosis of nf1.\nduplicon-mediated microdeletions around the nf1 gene are frequently associated with a severe form of neurofibromatosis type i in a subgroup of patients who show an earlier onset of cutaneous neurofibromas, dysmorphic facial features, and lower iq values.\nneurofibromatosis had been diagnosed in infancy, and genetic testing showed that the patient had a mutation in chromosome 17, consistent with neurofibromatosis type i.\nneurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) is one of the most common inherited diseases in humans. it is caused by a mutation in the nf1 gene on chromosome 17, and is associated with numerous central and peripheral nervous system manifestations.\nin 95% of nf1 individuals, a mutation is found in the nf1 gene, and in 5% of the patients, the germline mutation consists of a microdeletion that includes the nf1 gene and several flanking genes.\nherein, we describe a unique case of anaplastic de novo astroblastoma-sarcoma, in essence a variant of gliosarcoma, occurring in a 50-year-old female with documented nf1. genetic study (fluorescence in situ hybridization) demonstrated no chromosomal losses or gains. testing for abnormalities of chromosomes 7, 9, 10, 12, 17, 19 and 20, including the egfr, p16, pten, mdm2 and nf1 gene regions, we found the tumor to exhibit a deletion of pten, monosomy 17 and gains of chromosomes 19 and 20q.\nneurofibromatosis type i (nf1) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 3000 people. the nf1 gene is located on chromosome 17q11.2, spans 350 kb of genomic dna, and contains 60 exons.\na patient with recurrent-remittent multiple sclerosis associated with neurofibromatosis type i is described. the case is interesting for two reasons: 1) the difficulty of evaluating mri findings, since both entities involve similar anomalies and 2) the relation between the two entities, according to evidence from recent genetic studies showing that the myelin protein gene associated to oligodendrocytes is part of an intron of the neurofibromatosis-1 gene of chromosome 17.\nneurofibromatosis type i (nfi) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an increased risk for developing benign and malignant tumors. the nfi gene has been cloned and maps to 17q11.2, and the gene product acts as a tumor suppressor gene.\ndirect sequencing of the nf1 gene in tumor dna identified the presence of an inactivating nf1 somatic mutation in 41% (25/61) of analyzed sporadic tumors, associated with loss of the wild-type allele in 84% (21/25) of cases.\na novel mutation c.4821dela was identified in nf1 gene, which predicted truncation of neurofibromin (p.leu1607fs).\nshe had a genotype of heterozygous c.6709c>t mutation of nf1 gene.\nresults: the mutational analysis of the nf1 gene revealed a novel frameshift insertion mutation in exon 4c (c.654 ins a) in all affected family members.\nusing lymphoblastoid, fibroblast, and buccal cell samples collected from both twins and from other family members in three generations, we discovered a pathogenic nonsense mutation in exon 40 of the nf1 gene.\nwe also found a novel non-synonymous change in exon 16 of the nf1 gene that was transmitted from the unaffected mother to both twins and co-segregated with the pathogenic mutation in the ensuing generation.\nthe disease gene of the chinese nf1 family was linked to nf1 locus, and a nonsense mutation, g1336x in the nf1 gene was identified.\nthe present study demonstrated that g1336x mutation in the nf1 gene cause neurofibromatosis type i in the family.",

These results may provide an insight into the effects of missense or truncation mutations in BRCA2 in canine tumours.\nTriple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) do not represent a single disease subgroup and are often aggressive breast cancers with poor prognoses. Unlike estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) breast cancers, which are responsive to targeted treatments, there is no effective targeted therapy for TNBC, although approximately 50% of patients respond to conventional chemotherapies, including taxanes, anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and platinum salts\nGenetic BRCA2 insufficiency is associated with breast cancer development; however, in sporadic breast cancer cases, high BRCA2 expression is paradoxically correlated with poor prognosis\nHER-2 and TOP2A gene amplification showed a tendency to be associated with larger tumor size, positive lymph node status, high level of apoptotic and proliferative indexes, and low level of p53 and Bcl-2 expression, which all together indicate group of patients with similar outcome during the progression of the disease",

Here we show that Indian hedgehog (Ihh), another hedgehog family member, and Patched 1 (Ptc1), a receptor and negative regulator of hedgehog activity, are expressed in pancreatic tissue.\nThe original hedgehog (hh) gene was found in Drosophila and named for the appearance of a mutant phenotype which causes an embryo to be covered with pointy denticles, thus resembling a hedgehog. The hedgehog family consists of sonic hedgehog (Shh), desert hedgehog (Dhh), and Indian hedgehog (Ihh). \nIndian hedgehog (IHH) is a secreted signaling molecule of the hedgehog family known to play important roles in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation, cortical bone formation, and the development of joints.\nHedgehog (Hh) plays a pivotal role in various tissues during embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh).\nSonic hedgehog (SHH), Desert hedgehog (DHH) and Indian hedgehog (IHH) bind to Patched family receptors (PTCH1 and PTCH2) to transduce signals to GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3. GLI family transcription factors then activate transcription of Hedgehog target genes, such as FOXE1 and FOXM1 encoding Forkhead-box transcription factors.\nIndian hedgehog (IHH) and its receptors patched (PTC) and smoothened (SMO) belong to the hedgehog family of signaling molecules, which are essential for a variety of patterning events during mammalian tIssue development.\nIn mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh).\nA single Hh homolog is present in Drosophila, but three Hh homologs, Sonic Hh, Indian Hh, and Desert Hh, are present in mammals.\nA single Hh homolog is present in Drosophila, but three Hh homologs, Sonic Hh, Indian Hh, and Desert Hh, are present in mammals\nIn mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh)",

genomic dna.\ntranscription-coupled repair (tcr) since targets for dna damage are situated on the transcribed or coding strand of dna\nnucleotide excision repair (ner), which removes a variety of helix-distorting lesions from dna, is initiated by two distinct dna damage-sensing mechanisms. transcription coupled repair (tcr) removes damage from the active strand of transcribed genes\ntranscription-coupled repair (tcr) is a sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair that allows for the enhanced repair of the transcribed strand of active genes.\ntranscription coupled repair (tcr) is a nucleotide excision repair (ner) pathway that is dedicated to repair in the transcribed strand of an active gene.\ntranscription-coupled repair (tcr) is a pathway dedicated to the removal of damage from the template strands of actively transcribed genes.\nalthough the detailed mechanism of tcr is not yet understood, it is believed to be triggered when a translocating rna polymerase is arrested at a lesion or unusual structure in the dna.\namong these is a process called transcription-coupled repair (tcr) that catalyzes the removal of dna lesions from the transcribed strand of expressed genes, often resulting in a preferential bias of damage clearance from this strand relative to its non-transcribed counterpart.\nthese results suggest that uv treatment results in an induced repair of uv-damaged dna in the transcribed strand of an active gene in xp-c and normal cells through an enhancement of tcr or a mechanism which involves the tcr pathway.\ntcr can preferentially remove the bulky dna lesions located at the transcribed strand of a transcriptional active gene more rapidly than those at the untranscribed strand or overall genomic dna.\nthe proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (tcr), which is targeted to the transcribed strand in expressed genes.\ntranscription-coupled repair (tcr) is a universal sub-pathway of the nucleotide excision repair (ner) system that is limited to the transcribed strand of active structural genes.\nner can operate via two subpathways: global genome repair (ggr) and a specialized pathway coupled to active transcription (transcription-coupled repair, tcr) and directed to dna lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes.\ntranscription coupled repair (tcr), a special sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (ner), removes transcription blocking lesions rapidly from the transcribing strand of active genes.\ntranscription-coupled repair (tcr) acts solely on the transcribed strand of expressed genes, while global genomic repair (ggr) is responsible for the ubiquitous repair of the genome.\nin addition to the recognition and excision of dna damage throughout the genome (ggr), there exists a mechanism, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (tcr), for recognizing some types of dna damage in the transcribed strand of genes in escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells.\ntranscription-coupled repair (tcr) is a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (ner) that acts specifically on lesions in the transcribed strand of expressed genes.\nthe blockage of transcription elongation by rna polymerase ii (pol ii) at a dna damage site on the transcribed strand triggers a transcription-coupled dna repair (tcr), which rapidly removes dna damage on the transcribed strand of the expressed gene and allows the resumption of transcription.\nit has been previously shown that disruption of rad26 in yeast strain w303-1b results in a strain that is deficient in transcription-coupled repair (tcr), the preferential repair of the transcribed strand of an expressed gene over the non-transcribed strand and the rest of the genome.\nthe proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (tcr), which is

colchicine, which inhibits closterium cell elongation after division\nthe antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect.\ncells treated with ampicillin, d-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division\nwe investigated the effects of antibiotics that interfere with peptidoglycan biosynthesis on chloroplast division in the desmid closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex\nrecent advances in pneumococcal peptidoglycan biosynthesis suggest new vaccine and antimicrobial targets.\nof late, the peptidoglycan (pg) layer, the most important component of the bacterial cell wall has been the subject of drug targeting because, first, it is essential for the survivability of eubacteria and secondly, it is absent in humans.\nantibiotics which inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are the most widely used in current clinical practice.\na dose-response experiment with an e. coli strain susceptible to ampicillin demonstrated a weak effect before the mic dose.\n in an initial approach, the procedure accurately discriminates susceptible, intermediate and resistant strains of escherichia coli to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.\nsurprisingly, also cinnamycin of streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress.\nhere, we compare the staining patterns observed in bacillus subtilis using fluorescent derivatives of two pg-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin.\nramoplanin probes may be better imaging agents than vancomycin probes because they yield clear staining patterns at concentrations well below their minimum inhibitory concentrations.\nstructures of the muraymycins, novel peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibitors.\nthe muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety.\nthe muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis. \nrethinking ramoplanin: the role of substrate binding in inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis.\nramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis.\nvancomycin binds to bacterial cell-wall intermediates to achieve its antibiotic effect.\nthe lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at

-resistant bacteria by a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic.\nly191145 is a p-chlorobenzyl derivative of ly264826 (a82846b) with activity against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. incorporation of l-[14c]lysine into peptidoglycan of intact vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecium was inhibited by ly191145 (50% inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 5 microgram/ml, respectively). inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of udp-muramyl-peptide precursors in the cytoplasm\nthe fact that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by ly191145 was not readily antagonized by an excess of free acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine or acyl-d-alanyl-d-lactate ligands indicates that the manner in which this compound inhibits transglycosylation may not be identical to

produced by bacillus sp. strain hil y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin\nincubation of staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis.\nn contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics.\ninhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by ramoplanin.\nramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.\nbacitracin and other antibiotics that inhibit late stages in peptidoglycan biosynthesis induce vancomycin resistance in a high-level, inducibly vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococcus faecium.\nthis effect does not involve a change in the permeability of the cell wall by this drug and is consistent with the identification of d-alanine racemase as a target of d-cycloserine. \nconclusions: several pathways and genes downregulated by fosfomycin have been identified, in contrast to previously described cell wall active antibiotics, and was explained by starvation response induced by phosphoenolpyruvate accumulation. \nthe target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment. \nramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria. \nfosfomycin inhibited the first enzymatic step of peptidoglycan synthesis, which was followed by decreased levels of peptidoglycan precursors but enhanced levels of substrates such as udp-glcnac and alanine-alanine.\nin contrast, vancomycin and ampicillin inhibited the last stage of peptidoglycan construction on the outer cell surface.\nthe target pathway - peptidoglycan

pathway, which regulates the activity of ap-1 and induces met.\negulation of na,k-atpase \u03b21-subunit in tgf-\u03b22-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human retinal pigmented epithelial cells\nthe emt process is mediated via exposure to vitreous cytokines and growth factors such as tgf-\u03b22.\nprevious studies have shown that na,k-atpase is required for maintaining a normal polarized epithelial phenotype and that decreased na,k-atpase function and subunit levels are associated with tgf-\u03b21-mediated emt in kidney cells.\nloss of na,k-atpase \u03b21 is a potential contributor to tgf-\u03b22-mediated emt in rpe cells.\nmt (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) is crucial for cancer cells to acquire invasive phenotypes. in a549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, tgf-\u03b2 elicited emt in smad-dependent manner and tnf-\u03b1 accelerated this process, as confirmed by cell morphology, expression of emt markers, capacity of gelatin lysis and cell invasion.\ncomprehensive expression analysis unraveled genes differentially regulated by tgf-\u03b2 and tnf-\u03b1, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and ecm (extracellular matrices), suggesting the drastic change in autocrine/paracrine signals as well as cell-to-ecm interactions. \nour recent studies found that ccn1 plays a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through the induction of emt and stemness.\nhere we show that ccn1 regulates the sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling pathway, which is associated with the pdac progression and poor prognosis.\nshh regulation by ccn1 in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated through the active notch-1.\nthese extensive studies propose that targeting ccn1 can provide a new treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer since blocking ccn1 simultaneously blocks two critical pathways (i.e. shh and notch1) associated with the development of the disease as well as drug resistance.\ngf-\u03b2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition\nthe cytokine tgf-\u03b2, which is expressed by tumor-infiltrating immune cells, stands out as a master regulator of the pro-invasive tumor microenvironment. tgf-\u03b2 cooperates with stem cell pathways, such as wnt and ras signaling, to induce emt. in addition, tgf-\u03b2 contributes to an emt-permissive microenvironment by switching the phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, which thereby mount pro-invasive and pro-metastatic immune responses.\nin this review, we discuss the role of tgf-\u03b2-induced emt as a link between cancer and inflammation in the context of questions, which from our point of view are key to answer in order to understand the functionality of emt in tumors.\nranscription factors c-myc and cdx2 mediate e-selectin ligand expression in colon cancer cells undergoing egf/bfgf-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition\ntreatment of ht29 and dld-1 cells with egf and/or basic fgf (bfgf) induced emt and significantly increased sle(x/a) expression resulting in enhanced e-selectin binding activity.\nupon hypoxia, tgf\u03b2 addition or egfrviii expression, mcf7, a549 and nmumg epithelial cells acquired a spindle shape and lost cell-cell contacts. expression of epithelial markers such as e-cadherin decreased, whereas mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and n-cadherin increased.\nthe emt process can be regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta, whose activities are dysregulated during malignant tumor progression.\ntransforming growth factor-beta-induced tubular cell emt in c1.1 cells was inhibited by mmp-2/9 inhibitor. our in vitro study provides evidence that mmps, specifically mmp-9, secreted by effector macrophages can induce tubular cell emt and thereby contribute to renal fibrosis.\nnflammatory cytokines augments tgf-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a549 cells by up-regulating tbetar-i\nin this study, we report that cytomix (a mixture of il-1beta, tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma) significantly enhances tgf-beta1-induced emt in a549 cells as evidenced by acquisition of fibroblast-like cell shape, loss of e-cadherin, and reorganization of f-actin.\nil-1beta or tnf-alpha alone can also augment tgf-beta1-induced emt. however, a combination of il-1beta and tnf-alpha or the cytomix is more potent to induce emt.\nthese results indicate that inflammatory cytokines together with tgf-beta1 may play an important role in the development of fibrosis and tumor progress via the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\ntgf-beta stimulated epithelial to mesenchyme transdifferentiation (emt) in the presence of tgf-alpha, as characterized by increased expression of fibronectin and changes in tgf-beta receptor binding.\nemt is typically induced by transforming growth factor-beta1 (tgf-beta1) and inhibited by hepatocyte growth factor (hgf).\nexposure of mdck cells to 10 ng/ml tgf-beta1 for 72 h induced emt as evidenced by conversion to the spindle-like morphology, loss of e-cadherin, and activation of alpha-smooth muscle actin.\nin contrast, akt1 down-regulation in igf-ir-stimulated cells promoted dramatic neomorphic effects characteristic of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) and enhanced cell migration induced by igf-i or egf stimulation. the phenotypic effects of akt1 down-regulation were accompanied by enhanced extracellular signal-related kinase (erk) activation, which contributed to the induction of migration and emt.\nransforming growth factors beta (tgf-betas) inhibit growth of epithelial cells and induce differentiation changes, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt).\nha-ras cooperates with transforming growth factor beta (tgfbeta) to cause epithelial mesenchymal transition (emt) characterized by spindle-like cell morphology, loss of epithelial markers, and induction of mesenchymal markers.\nigf-ii induces rapid beta-catenin relocation to the nucleus during epithelium to mesenchyme transition\nwe can show that (1) igf-ii induces a rapid epithelium to mesenchymal transition;\nbased on the given case of igf-ii and e-cadherin/beta-catenin complex, this study reveals the backbone of a cascade connecting growth factor signaling with cell-cell adhesion during emt.\nthe nbt-ii rat carcinoma cell line exhibits two mutually exclusive responses to fgf-1 and egf, entering mitosis at cell confluency while undergoing an epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (emt) when cultured at subconfluency.\nemt requires continuous tgfbeta receptor (tgfbeta-r) and oncogenic ras signaling and is stabilized by autocrine tgfbeta production\nemt seems to be a close in vitro correlate of metastasis, both requiring synergism between tgfbeta-r and raf/mapk signaling",

imprint resetting or maintenance in the male germ line.\nspecificity of dnmt1 for methylation of hemimethylated cpg sites resides in its catalytic domain.\nwe obtained evidence that some 5-methylcytosine residues in these single-stranded dnas can stimulate de novo methylation of adjacent sites by murine dna 5-cytosine methyltransferase as effectively as 5-methylcytosine residues in double-stranded dna stimulate maintenance methylation.\nwe present in vitro evidence that the mammalian de novo dna methyltransferases dnmt3a and dnmt3b, but not the maintenance enzyme dnmt1, are also redox-dependent dna dehydroxymethylases.\ndirect comparison to met1 plants, deficient in maintenance methyltransferase met1, showed higher sensitivity of ddm1 plants to nacl.\ndnmt1, the major maintenance dna methyltransferase in animals, helps to regulate gene expression, genome imprinting, and x-chromosome inactivation.\ncorrect establishment and maintenance of methylation patterns at imprinted genes has been associated with placental function and regulation of embryonic/fetal development.\ncontributions of ctcf and dna methyltransferases dnmt1 and dnmt3b to epstein-barr virus restricted latency.\nthus, differential expression of ctcf and dnmt1 and -3b is not critical for maintenance of restricted latency.\nrecent studies demonstrate that uhrf1 is required for dna methylation maintenance by targeting dnmt1 to dna replication foci, presumably through its unique hemi-methylated dna-binding activity and interaction with dnmt1.\nit is generally accepted that dna methyltransferases carry out specific and non-overlapping functions, dnmt3a and dnmt3b being responsible for the establishment of methylation around the time of implantation and dnmt1 ensuring that methylation is faithfully copied to daughter cells via what has come to be known as \"maintenance methylation.\"\na new model is emerging that takes into account a contribution of the de novo enzymes dnmt3a and dnmt3b in the maintenance of the dna methylation.\nwe propose here observations in support of the hypothesis that the maintenance of methylation and subsequent silencing of a handful of germ line genes requires dnmt3b but not dnmt1.\ndna methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) is the enzyme responsible for maintaining the methylation marks through cell division. however, the de novo methyltransferases, dnmt3a and dnmt3b, can also contribute to the maintenance of the methylation pattern.\nthese new data support the notion that de novo dnmts also have an important role in the maintenance of dna methylation and suggest that, in addition to acting as oncogenes, they also behave as tumor suppressors.\nstructural insight into maintenance methylation by mouse dna methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1).\nthe dna methyltransferase dnmt1 is responsible for the propagation of methylation patterns to the next generation via its preferential methylation of hemimethylated cpg sites in the genome; however, how dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns is not fully understood.\nusp7 and uhrf1 control ubiquitination and stability of the maintenance dna methyltransferase dnmt1.\nin mammals dnmt1 is the dna methyltransferase chiefly responsible for maintaining genomic methylation patterns through dna replication cycles, but how its maintenance activity is controlled is still not well understood.\ndmap1 is a potent activator of dnmt1 methylation in vitro, suggesting that dmap1 is a co-repressor that supports the maintenance and de novo action of dnmt1.\na group of enzymes, the dna methyltransferases (dnmts) tightly regulate both the initiation and maintenance of these methyl marks.\nmaintenance of dna methylation depends on dna methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) and intracellular s-adenosylmethionine (sam) levels, and is inhibited by s-adenosylhomocysteine (sah).\nwhile dnmt3a is mostly involved in de novo methylation, dnmt1 acts as a maintenance methyltransferase.\nwe propose a new model that suggests that the maintenance of dna methylation relies not only on the recognition of hemimethylated dna by dna methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) but also on the localization of the dnmt3a and dnmt3b enzymes to specific chromatin regions that contain methylated dna.\nthe maintenance methylase, dnmt1 (dna methyltransferase 1), is a prominent enzyme in the process that is linked to dna replication and drives the heritable nature of epigenetic modifications.\nwe have shown previously that these drugs selectively and rapidly induce degradation of the maintenance dna methyltransferase (dnmt) 1 by a proteasomal pathway.\ninheritance of epigenetic information encoded by cytosine dna methylation patterns is crucial for mammalian cell survival, in large part through the activity of the maintenance dna methyltransferase (dnmt1).\nwe and others have shown that dna methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1), the maintenance methyltransferase, contributes to the cellular response to dna damage, yet dnmt1's exact role in this process remains unclear.\nthe maintenance function of dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory n-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated dna.\nin the absence of a human pituitary tumor cell line, small interfering rna-mediated knockdown of the maintenance methyltransferase dna methyltransferase (cytosine 5)-1 (dnmt1) was used in the murine pituitary adenoma cell line att-20.\nwe found that dna methylation was maintained only when exogenous dna methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) and s-adenosyl methionine (sam) were added to the reaction.\nwe examined the expression of dnmt1 and dnmt3a, representative of a maintenance and de novo methyltransferase respectively, in response to in-vitro depolarization of cortical neurons, using standard techniques such as high potassium (kcl) or the sodium channel agonist veratridine.\ndna methyltransferase-1 (dnmt1) has a higher specific activity on hemimethylated dna than on unmethylated dna, but this preference is too small to explain the faithful mitotic inheritance of genomic methylation patterns. new genetic studies in plants and mammals have identified a novel factor that increases the fidelity of maintenance methylation.\ndnmt1 is the main maintenance methyltransferase in the mouse and its expression is regulated by a splicing mechanism that dictates the expression of stage-specific isoforms.\nphosphorylation of serine-515 activates the mammalian maintenance methyltransferase dnmt1.\ndna methyltransferase 1 methylates hemi-methylated cg sites generated during dna replication.\ndna methylation is catalyzed by a family of dna methyltransferases (dnmts) including the maintenance enzyme dnmt 1 and de novo methyltransferases dnmt 3a and dnmt 3b.\nour data suggest that dnmt1 might be essential for maintenance of dna methylation, proliferation, and survival of cancer cells.\nmaintenance dna methyltransferase (met1) and silencing of cpg-methylated foreign dna in volvox carteri.\ndna methylation plays an important role in the gene-silencing network of higher eukaryotes. we have analyzed the 21.5-kb maintenance methyltransferase (m-mtase) gene, met1, of the multicellular green alga volvox carteri.\ndna damage-induced down-regulation of human cdc25c and cdc2 is mediated by cooperation between p53 and maintenance dna (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1.\nmethylation at the 5-position of dna cytosine on the vertebrate genomes is accomplished by the combined catalytic actions of three dna methyltransferases (dnmts), the de novo enzymes dnmt3a and dnmt3b and the maintenance enzyme dnmt1.\ndna methylation, the major form of epigenetic modifications, is catalyzed by the maintenance dna methyltransferase (dnmt) 1 and/or the de novo methyltransferases dnmt3a and dnmt3b.\nthe maintenance methylation of hemimethylated cpg sites by the dna methyltransferase dnmt1 is the molecular basis of the inheritance of dna methylation patterns.\nthe allosteric site(s) on dnmt1 can regulate processes of de novo and maintenance dna methylation in cells.\ndnmt1 (dna methyltransferase 1) is the principal enzyme responsible for maintenance of cytosine methylation at cpg dinucleotides in the mammalian genome.\nmaintenance of genomic methylation patterns is mediated primarily by dna methyltransferase-1 (dnmt1).\nin this study, we showed that dnmt1, which encodes a methylation maintenance enzyme, is a transcriptional target of brca1.\ndna methyltransferases (dnmts) are essential for maintenance of aberrant methylation in cancer cells and play important roles in the development of cancers.\ndna methyltransferase-1 (dnmt1) is involved in the maintenance of dna methylation patterns and is crucial for normal mammalian development.\ndnmt1, which is important for maintenance of methylation, increased across development and stayed high in adult cortex.\nour results indicate that dnmt1 plays the main role in maintenance of methylation of cxcr4 promoter, while dnmt3b may function as an accessory dna methyltransferase to modulate cxcr4 expression in aspc1 cells.\ndna methylation patterns are established and maintained by three dna methyltransferases: dnmt1, dnmt3a, and dnmt3b.\naccording to their structure and functions, dna methyltransferases (dnmts) are divided into two major families in mammalian cells: maintenance methyltransferase (dnmt1) and de novo methyltransferases (dnmt3a, dnmt3b, and dnmt3l).\nthe 5-lox dna methylation increased with the age of the

synthesis with greater specificity for 17,20-lyase than for 17\u03b1-hydroxylase.\nbased on these observations, potent agents targeting the ar axis were developed: 1) inhibitors of cyp17 (a key enzyme in the production of androgens), such as abiraterone and orteronel; 2) ar antagonists that bind to ar and impair ar activation, such as enzalutamide and arn-509. \norteronel inhibits the 17,20 lyase activity of the enzyme cyp17a1, which is important for androgen synthesis in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells. \ninhibition of 17\u03b1-hydroxylase by abiraterone results in accumulation of upstream mineralocorticoids due to loss of cortisol-mediated suppression of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth), providing a rationale for development of cyp17 inhibitors with increased specificity for 17,20-lyase (orteronel, galeterone and vt-464) that can potentially be administered without exogenous corticosteroids.\nphase i/ii trial of orteronel (tak-700)--an investigational 17,20-lyase inhibitor--in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\norteronel (tak-700) is an investigational, oral, nonsteroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in the production of androgenic hormones. \nhence, some molecules target the androgen biosynthesis, as abiraterone acetate and orteronel, which are selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyp17.\nto achieve enhanced clinical benefits, new strategies are being explored that include selective inhibition of the c17,20-lyase activity of cyp17 and multi-targeting strategies that affect androgen synthesis and signalling at different points. some of these strategies-including the drugs orteronel, vt-464 and galeterone--are supported by preclinical data and are being explored in the clinic.\nbesides further cyp17 inhibitors (orteronel, galeterone, vt-464 and cfg920), androgen receptor antagonists (arn-509, odm-201, azd-3514 and ezn-4176) and vaccine prostvac, more drug candidates with various mechanisms or new indications of launched drugs are currently under evaluation in different stages of clinical trials, including various kinase inhibitors and platinum complexes. \neffect of an investigational cyp17a1 inhibitor, orteronel (tak-700), on estrogen- and corticoid-synthesis pathways in hypophysectomized female rats and on the serum estradiol levels in female cynomolgus monkeys.\norteronel (tak-700) is an investigational, non-steroidal inhibitor of cyp17a1 with preferential inhibition of 17,20-lyase in nci-h295 cells. \nin summary, orteronel can suppress serum estradiol concentrations in hypophysectomized female rats and monkeys through selective inhibition of cyp17a1 activity, suggesting that orteronel might be effective for hormone-dependent breast cancers and estrogen-dependent diseases.\ndevelopment and validation of an rp-hplc method for the quantitation of orteronel (tak-700), a cyp17a1 enzyme inhibitor, in rat

          "context": "alternating electric fields (tumor-treating fields therapy) can improve chemotherapy treatment efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo.\ne evaluated the effects of combining ttfields with standard chemotherapeutic agents on several nsclc cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo. frequency titration curves demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of ttfields were maximal at 150 khz for all nsclc cell lines tested, and that the addition of ttfields to chemotherapy resulted in enhanced treatment efficacy across all cell lines. \ntogether, these findings suggest that combining ttfields therapy with chemotherapy may provide an additive efficacy benefit in the management of nsclc.\nresponse patterns of recurrent glioblastomas treated with tumor-treating fields.\nnovottf therapy is a novel and us food and drug administration (fda)-approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent gbm with potential benefits compared with other options. recurrent gbm patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single-agent novottf therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and os. in addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict gbm response to tumor-treating fields (ttfields). the overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase iii trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. tumor responses to novottf therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months).\nnovottf therapy is a novel antimitotic treatment for recurrent gbm associated with slowly developing but durable tumor responses in approximately 15% of patients.\nthe effect of field strength on glioblastoma multiforme response in patients treated with the novottf\u2122-100a system.\n an ongoing trial is assessing its efficacy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) and it has been fda-approved for recurrent gbm.\nwe present three patients with gbm in whom the fields were adjusted at recurrence and the effects of each adjustment.\nthe first patient underwent subtotal resection, radiotherapy with temozolomide (tmz), and then began novottf therapy with metronomic tmz. \n a second patient underwent two resections followed by radiotherapy/tmz and novottf therapy/tmz. six months later, two new distal lesions were noted, and he underwent further resection with adjustment of his fields. he remained stable over the subsequent year on novottf therapy and bevacizumab. a third patient on novottf therapy/tmz remained stable for two years but developed a small, slow growing enhancing lesion, which was resected, and his fields were adjusted accordingly. \na phase i/ii trial of tumor treating fields (ttfields) therapy in combination with pemetrexed for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\npromising preclinical data have led to a single arm phase i/ii trial in nsclc patients.methods: forty-two inoperable stage iiib (with pleural effusion) and iv nsclc patients who had had tumor progression received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) iv q3w together with daily ttfields therapy until disease progression.\nthe median time to in-field progression was 28 weeks and the median time to systemic progression was 22 weeks.\nconclusions: the combination of ttfields and pemetrexed as a second line therapy for nsclc is safe and potentially more effective than pemetrexed alone. ttfields improved disease control within the treatment field and a phase iii study is planned to further investigate its role as a novel treatment in nsclc.\ntumor treating fields (ttfields) is a noninvasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma by the u.s. fda and has a ce mark in europe. \nthe antimitotic effect of ttfields therapy has been demonstrated in multiple cell lines when the appropriate frequency was utilized. a phase iii trial of ttfields monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients established that ttfields therapy is associated with minimal toxicity, better quality of life, and comparable efficacy to chemotherapy. ongoing and future trials will evaluate ttfields in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, solid tumor brain metastases, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and ovarian and pancreatic cancers.\nthe u.s. food and drug administration has approved the first device, the novottf-100a\u2122, that uses this technology and is indicated for use in progressive glioblastoma multiforme after standard therapies have failed. promising clinical trial results will likely lead to expanded uses in primary brain tumors and other cancer types. \nlong-term survival of patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme treated with tumor-treating fields.\ntumor-treating fields (ttfield) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received ce and fda approval for the treatment of rgbm, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 khz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types. our center was the first to apply ttfield treatment to histologically proven gbm in a small pilot study of 20 individuals in 2004 and 2005, and four of those original 20 patients are still alive today. we report two cases of gbm and two cases of rgbm treated by ttfield therapy, all in good health and no longer receiving any treatment more than seven years after initiating ttfield therapy, with no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence.\ntumor treating fields (ttfields) are low intensity (1 ? 2 v/cm), intermediate frequency (100 ? 200 khz) alternating electric fields administered using insulated electrodes placed on the skin surrounding the region of a malignant tumor. \nfurthermore, it summarizes the clinical experience with ttfields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized phase iii trial ttfields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): ttfields significantly improved median overall survival (os) compared with standard therapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol.\nthe second indication was a phase ii study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where ttfields was administered concomitantly with pemetrexed. \nexpert opinion: the proof of concept of ttfields has been well demonstrated in the preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor types. \nconclusions: the results indicate that ttfields alone and in combination with paclitaxel

Frequency titration curves demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of TTFields were maximal at 150 kHz for all NSCLC cell lines tested, and that the addition of TTFields to chemotherapy resulted in enhanced treatment efficacy across all cell lines. \nTogether, these findings suggest that combining TTFields therapy with chemotherapy may provide an additive efficacy benefit in the management of NSCLC.\nResponse patterns of recurrent glioblastomas treated with tumor-treating fields.\nNovoTTF Therapy is a novel and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM with potential benefits compared with other options. Recurrent GBM patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single-agent NovoTTF Therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and OS. In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields). The overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase III trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months).\nNovoTTF Therapy is a novel antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM associated with slowly developing but durable tumor responses in approximately 15% of patients.\nThe effect of field strength on glioblastoma multiforme response in patients treated with the NovoTTF\u2122-100A system.\n An ongoing trial is assessing its efficacy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and it has been FDA-approved for recurrent GBM.\nWe present three patients with GBM in whom the fields were adjusted at recurrence and the effects of each adjustment.\nThe first patient underwent subtotal resection, radiotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ), and then began NovoTTF Therapy with metronomic TMZ. \n A second patient underwent two resections followed by radiotherapy/TMZ and NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ. Six months later, two new distal lesions were noted, and he underwent further resection with adjustment of his fields. He remained stable over the subsequent year on NovoTTF Therapy and bevacizumab. A third patient on NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ remained stable for two years but developed a small, slow growing enhancing lesion, which was resected, and his fields were adjusted accordingly. \nA phase I/II trial of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy in combination with pemetrexed for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\nPromising preclinical data have led to a single arm phase I/II trial in NSCLC patients.METHODS: Forty-two inoperable stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) and IV NSCLC patients who had had tumor progression received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) iv q3w together with daily TTFields therapy until disease progression.\nThe median time to in-field progression was 28 weeks and the median time to systemic progression was 22 weeks.\nCONCLUSIONS: The combination of TTFields and pemetrexed as a second line therapy for NSCLC is safe and potentially more effective than pemetrexed alone. TTFields improved disease control within the treatment field and a phase III study is planned to further investigate its role as a novel treatment in NSCLC.\nTumor treating fields (TTFields) is a noninvasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma by the U.S. FDA and has a CE mark in Europe. \nThe antimitotic effect of TTFields therapy has been demonstrated in multiple cell lines when the appropriate frequency was utilized. A phase III trial of TTFields monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients established that TTFields therapy is associated with minimal toxicity, better quality of life, and comparable efficacy to chemotherapy. Ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFields in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, solid tumor brain metastases, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and ovarian and pancreatic cancers.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first device, the NovoTTF-100A\u2122, that uses this technology and is indicated for use in progressive glioblastoma multiforme after standard therapies have failed. Promising clinical trial results will likely lead to expanded uses in primary brain tumors and other cancer types. \nLong-term survival of patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme treated with tumor-treating fields.\nTumor-treating fields (TTField) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received CE and FDA approval for the treatment of RGBM, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 kHz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types. Our center was the first to apply TTField treatment to histologically proven GBM in a small pilot study of 20 individuals in 2004 and 2005, and four of those original 20 patients are still alive today. We report two cases of GBM and two cases of RGBM treated by TTField therapy, all in good health and no longer receiving any treatment more than seven years after initiating TTField therapy, with no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence.\nTumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity (1 ? 2 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100 ? 200 kHz) alternating electric fields administered using insulated electrodes placed on the skin surrounding the region of a malignant tumor. \nFurthermore, it summarizes the clinical experience with TTFields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized Phase III trial TTFields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): TTFields significantly improved median overall survival (OS) compared with standard therapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol.\nThe second indication was a Phase II study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where TTFields was administered concomitantly with pemetrexed. \nEXPERT OPINION: The proof of concept of TTFields has been well demonstrated in the preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor types. \nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that TTFields alone and in combination with paclitaxel and doxorubicin effectively reduce the viability of both wild type and MDR cell sub-lines and thus can potentially be used as an effective treatment of drug resistant tumors.\nAlternating electric fields (TTFields) inhibit metastatic spread of solid tumors to the lungs.\nTumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity, intermediate frequency, alternating electric fields used to treat cancerous tumors.

electron microscopy of the liver showed perisinusoidal fibrosis.\nthe poems syndrome is a rare multisystemic disorder with polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy of various forms production of monoclonal m component and skin changes we describe a 46 year old man who developed ascites one year after the onset of peripheral neuropathy with accompanying muscle atrophies and increasing weakness extensive evaluation revealed that the patient had no underlying liver disease malignancy infection or cardiac or renal disease the ascites initially responded to high dose corticosteroid therapy the patient had many clinical features of the described poems syndrome including sclerotic bone lesions a persistent lambda paraprotein and refractory ascites in this case ascites was a main presenting feature thus the poems syndrome must be added to the list of rare causes of refractory ascites.\npoems syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation associated with hematopoietic disorders such as multiple myeloma and castleman disease poems is an acronym for the main clinical features of the syndrome namely polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy m protein and skin abnormalities glomeruloid hemangiomas are considered to be a specific clinical marker of poems syndrome however while they are not pathognomonic their presence should raise suspicion of this syndrome or alert clinicians to its possible future development as these lesions can appear years before the onset of the syndrome we report the cases of 2 women with plasma cell dyscrasias and sudden onset of lesions with a vascular appearance and histologic findings consistent with glomeruloid hemangioma recognition of this vascular tumor is important for the early diagnosis of poems syndrome.\npoems syndrome is a rare

syndrome should be directed at the underlying plasma cell clone with risk-adapted therapy based on the extent of the plasma cell disorder.\nPolyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disorder.\nPOEMS is an acronym for the main clinical features of the syndrome, namely, Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, M protein, and Skin abnormalities.\nPOEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes) is a multisystem disorder with a good long-term prognosis.\nThe association of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes forms a characteristic multisystem syndrome, Crow-Fukase syndrome, or acronym POEMS syndrome.\nPolyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a multisystem disorder arising from underlying plasma cell dyscrasia.\nPolyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is an uncommon condition related to a paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to an underlying plasma cell disorder.\nPulmonary hypertension is one of the well-known clinical manifestations of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome, occurring in approximately 25-30% of the affected individuals.\nPolyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a rare disorder.\nPolyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome, a plasma cell dyscrasia associated with pulmonary hypertension, has been treated in the past with anticytokine strategies with a poor outcome.\nA 48-year-old man with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome had bilateral optic disc edema (ODE), bilateral cystoid macular edema (CME), anasarca, and elevated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\nA 39-year-old woman presented with polyneuropathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein and skin changes, several of the many clinical features of the recently described POEMS syndrome.\nThe acronym POEMS is derived from main features of the syndrome namely 'polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin lesions'.\nPOEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome, represents a rare multisystem syndrome characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes.\nPolyneuropathy is often an initial manifestation of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome and therefore this disorder is frequently misdiagnosed as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).\nPOEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic condition, commonly associated with Castleman disease, that manifests with progressive distal polyneuropathy and a monoclonal plasma cell disorder, often accompanied by endocrinopathy, organomegaly, skin changes, sclerotic bone lesions, ascites, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis.\nPOEMS syndrome, a rare multisystem disease, is a variant of osteosclerotic myeloma and is characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal proteins, and skin changes.\nWe report a case of a 64-year-old man with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes) syndrome that had been previously misdiagnosed as systemic sclerosis.\nPOEMS syndrome is a rare plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes.\nThe POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammapathy, and skin changes) syndrome is a rare variant of plasma cell dyscrasia with multisystemic manifestations.\na 39 year old woman presented with polyneuropathy hepatomegaly splenomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal protein and skin changes several of the many clinical features of the recently described poems syndrome in addition she had a castleman s disease angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia in this case ascites was a main presenting feature thus the poems syndrome must be added to the list of rare causes of ascites electron microscopy of the liver showed perisinusoidal fibrosis.\nthe poems syndrome is a rare multisystemic disorder with polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy of various forms production of monoclonal m component and skin changes we describe a 46 year old man who developed ascites one year after the onset of peripheral neuropathy with accompanying muscle atrophies and increasing weakness extensive evaluation revealed that the patient had no underlying liver disease malignancy infection or cardiac or renal disease the ascites initially responded to high dose corticosteroid therapy the patient had many clinical features of the described poems syndrome including sclerotic bone lesions a persistent lambda paraprotein and refractory ascites in this case ascites was a main presenting feature thus the poems syndrome must be added to the list of rare causes of refractory ascites.\npoems syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation associated with hematopoietic disorders such as multiple myeloma and castleman disease poems is an acronym for the main clinical features of the syndrome namely polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy m protein and skin abnormalities glomeruloid hemangiomas are considered to be a specific clinical marker of poems syndrome however while they are not pathognomonic their presence should raise suspicion of this syndrome or alert clinicians to its possible future development as these lesions can appear years before the onset of the syndrome we report the cases of 2 women with plasma cell dyscrasias and sudden onset of lesions with a vascular appearance and histologic findings consistent with glomeruloid hemangioma recognition of this vascular tumor is important for the early diagnosis of poems syndrome.\npoems syndrome is a rare conglomeration of disorders associated with plasma cell dyscrasia the acronym poems is derived from main features of the syndrome namely polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal gammopathy and skin lesions other clinical features include presence of sclerotic bone lesions castleman s disease papilledema pleural effusion edema ascites erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis myeloma is the most common plasma cell dyscrasia associated with poems syndrome renal involvement is rare and renal biopsy is characterized by glomerular involvement with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and endothelial injury we report a case of a 67 year old male who presented with clinical features satisfying the diagnostic criteria of poems syndrome and had rapidly progressive renal failure renal biopsy showed extensive interstitial infiltration by plasma cells and concomitant presence of classic polyarteritis nodosa although association with small vessel vasculitis has been reported in patients with poems syndrome to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of poems syndrome associated with medium sized vessel vasculitis.\npoems syndrome also known as crow fukase syndrome represents a rare multisystem syndrome characterized by polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy m protein and skin changes hypothyroidism is one of the common endocrine abnormalities which are central features of poems syndrome the clinical data associated with the measurement of thyroid function and its clinical significance in poems syndrome is still rare herein we report 24 cases with poems syndrome which were studied thyroid function and clinical manifestations and performed an associated analysis between hypothyroidism and edema effusions of the 24 patients with poems syndrome 17 70 8 had a recognized hypothyroidism including 11 clinical hypothyroidism and 6 subclinical hypothyroidism fourteen patients 58 3 had some form of extravascular volume overload in 14 patients with edema effusions 12 were diagnosed as having hypothyroidism hypothyroidism may be one of causes of edema effusions after thyroid hormone treatment and chemotherapy symptoms of hypothyroidism and edema effusions were improved greatly.\nwe present a case of a woman with unique multisystem disorder poems syndrome and endocrine abnormalities coexisting with it the poems acronym comprises the dominant features polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal protein m protein skin changes association between plasma cell dyscrasia and polyneuropathy was described in 1956 year by crow the main features were coined in the acronym poems by bardwick in 1980 year the polysymptomatic clinical picture progressive course and no concurrent manifestations of main features impede the diagnosis in this case the first symptoms were the sensomotor polyneuropathy peripheral oedema osteosclerotic bone lesions skin changes organomegaly they preceded diagnosis by 3 years the first endocrinopathy was hypothyroidism definite diagnosis was delayed because we couldn t detect the presence of m protein immunoelectrophoresis didn t detect it but analysis by immunofixation detected m protein in serum and urine within 3 years of the first symptoms she developed hypogonadism hypergonadotropic at first the monotherapy with corticosteroids was used then melfalan with prednisone due to the progression of the disease a thalidomide was used in therapy it is anti vegf agent one of the side effects of the treatment of thalidomide is the progression of polyneuropathy which was observed in this patient after finishing this therapy she received chemotherapy this case report imposes the necessity of constants observation of patients with poems syndrome because there is a possibility of their developing other disorders in the event of coexistence polyneuropathy and plasma cell dyscrasia this disease should be taken into consideration.",

responsible for chac and mls, respectively, in 85 mood disorder subjects and xk in 86 schizophrenia subjects and compared the variants to 100 or more control alleles.\nwe hypothesized that because the xk gene is x-linked, it would be easy to identify spontaneously arising red cells with a phenotype resembling the mcleod syndrome, which results from inherited xk mutations. \nidentification and characterization of a novel xk splice site mutation in a patient with mcleod syndrome.\nmcleod syndrome is caused by mutations in the xk gene whose product is expressed at the red blood cell (rbc) surface but whose function is currently unknown.\nthe responsible xk mutation was characterized at the mrna level by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (pcr), identified by genomic dna sequencing, and verified by allele-specific pcr.\na novel xk splice site mutation (ivs1-1g>a) has been identified in a mcleod patient who has developed hematologic, neuromuscular, and neurologic symptoms. this is the first reported example of a xk point mutation affecting the 3' acceptor splice site of intron 1, and it was demonstrated that this mutation indeed induces aberrant splicing of xk rna and lack of xk protein at the rbc membrane.\nthe detailed characterization at the molecular biology level of this novel xk splice site mutation associated with the clinical description of the patient contributes to a better understanding of the phenotype-genotype correlation in the mcleod syndrome.\ngenetic test revealed a r133x mutation of the xk gene, confirming the mcleod syndrome.\nmolecular genetic analysis revealed a small deletion in the xk gene (938-942delctcta), which has been already described in a north american patient of anglo-saxon descent and a japanese family, presenting with seizures, muscle atrophy or chorea yet absence of psychiatric features.\na variety of mutations have been found in the responsible gene (xk) including single nonsense and missense mutations, nucleotide mutations at or near the splice junctions of introns of xk, and different deletion mutations. \nthe first case had been authenticated as a genuine mcleod both by serology and by genotyping (r222g missense mutation) and the second case had a mutation in xk (ivs2+5g>a) and by serology exhibited very weak kx antigen and no detectable kell antigens, except extremely low k antigen by adsorption-elution technique. \ndespite documented mcleod phenotype on rbcs, and identified mutations of xk, neurologic and other clinical findings were minimal at ages expected to manifest mls. \nthe different xk mutations may have different effects upon the xk gene product and thus may account for the variable phenotype.\ninsights into extensive deletions around the xk locus associated with mcleod phenotype and characterization of two novel cases.\nthe mcleod phenotype is derived from various forms of xk gene defects that result in the absence of xk protein, and is defined hematologically by the absence of kx antigen, weakening of kell system antigens, and red cell acanthocytosis. \nmls is an x-linked multi-system disorder caused by absence of xk alone, or when the disorder is caused by large deletions, it may be accompanied with duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd), chronic granulomatous disease (cybb), retinitis pigmentosa (rpgr), and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (otc). \ncase 1 has greater than 1.12 million base-pairs (mb) deletion around the xk locus with 7 genes affected.\nthe mcleod syndrome, one of the core neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, is a rare x-linked disorder caused by mutations of the xk gene, an x-chromosomal gene of unknown function characterized by haemopoietic abnormalities and late-onset neurological and muscular defects. \nlinkage analysis and sequencing revealed a xk gene mutation (mcleod syndrome).\nmcleod syndrome: life-long neuropsychiatric disorder due to a novel mutation of the xk gene.\ndna studies demonstrated a single-base deletion at position 172 in exon 1 of the xk gene, giving rise to a premature stop codon at position 129 in exon 2.\nmcleod syndrome resulting from a novel xk mutation.\nmls is caused by hemizygosity for mutations in the xk gene. \nthe patient's daughters had two populations of red cells, consistent with them being heterozygous for an xk0 allele. the molecular basis of mls in this family is a novel mutation consisting of a 7453-bp deletion that includes exon 2 of the xk gene. this confirms that the patient's 7-year-old grandson, who is currently asymptomatic, also has the xk0 allele and is therefore likely to develop mls.\nmcleod phenotype associated with a xk missense mutation without hematologic, neuromuscular, or cerebral involvement.\nxk gene sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in exon 3 (e327k). wbc xk rna levels were not decreased. \nknown disease-causing xk gene mutations comprised deletions, nonsense, or splice-site mutations predicting absent or truncated xk protein devoid of the kell-protein binding site. although the e327k missense mutation was associated with the immunohematologic characteristics of mcleod syndrome, the mutated xk protein seemed to be largely functional. these findings contribute to the understanding of the physiology of xk and kell proteins, and the pathogenetic mechanisms of acanthocytosis, myopathy, and striatal neurodegeneration in mcleod syndrome.\nwith the discovery of their molecular bases, mutations of the x-linked gene xk and autosomal recessive mutations of the gene coding for chorein, respectively, the two phenotypes can now be differentiated and extend the diagnostic spectrum in patients presenting with chorea.\nmcleod syndrome is caused by mutations of

common cause of les.\nwe report an unusual case of les associated with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (lcnec) of the lung.\nthe lambert-eaton syndrome is caused by antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels and often occurs in patients with small cell lung cancer.\na 53 year-old heavy smoker presented with a lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome (lems). bronchoscopy was normal

revealed a squamous cell carcinoma.\nlems is generally associated with small cell lung cancer occurring in three percent of cases.\nhowever, the case that we report shows the unusual association of lems with non small-cell lung cancer and highlights the difficulties associated in the management of this condition.\nlems has a high degree of coincidence (approximately 60%) with small cell lung cancer; the remaining 40% of patients with lems have no detectable tumor.\nbackground: to enhance the acknowledgement of lambert-eaton syndrome in patients with small cell lung cancer.\nthere were 10 cases of lambert-eaton syndrome in 332 pathologically diagnosed small cell lung cancer\ntreatment of small cell lung cancer may improve the symptoms of lambert-eaton syndrome\nimproving the recognition of lambert-eaton syndrome may be helpful to identify early small cell lung cancer and improve the prognosis,as the symptom of muscular weakness usually appears early before the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.\nthe lambert eaton syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation of small-cell lung cancer in 50% of the cases unlike generalized myasthenia which apparently is never associated with small-cell lung cancer.\nparaneoplastic lambert-eaton myasthenia syndrome is presented in two cases with small cell lung cancer.\nhuman small-cell lung cancer (sclc) cells are believed to express the antigens responsible for the production of pathological antibodies in the lambert-eaton syndrome (les), a ca2+ channel disorder in which quantal transmitter release from the motor nerve terminal is impaired.\nlambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome (lems) is a paraneoplastic autoimmune disorder caused by an igg-mediated reduction in number of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (vgcc) at the neuromuscular junction. in at least 50% of cases, the stimulus for antibody production may be vgcc on small cell lung cancer (sclc)\nalso, there was no obvious band pattern distinguishing patients with les from those with les and concurrent sclc.\nthe cancer associated with lems was small-cell lung carcinoma (sclc) in 15 cases and epidermoid lung carcinoma in 3 cases.\netiology of this disease is uncertain but in view of its frequent association with small cell lung cancer, this specific type of neoplasm may be implicated in the initiation of autoimmune response.\nrecent studies indeed support the possibility that the antigenic stimulus in the neoplastic form of les may arise from voltage-dependent ca2+ channels found in the lung cancer cells.\nin the majority of lems patients, those having detectable tumor, the disease is thought to occur as a result of immune response directed initially against voltage-gated ca2+ channels found on the lung tumor cells.\nradiological, bronchoscopic and histological investigations revealed small-cell lung cancer, and neurophysiological investigations confirmed a diagnosis of lems.\nphysicians need to be aware that patients may develop pcd and lems associated with anti-vgcc antibody caused by small cell lung cancer, and a mass survey should be conducted and careful examinations performed.\nbiopsy revealed small cell lung cancer (sclc) indicating the importance of repeated chest ct in lems even when an existing autoimmune-like disease and negative ct may suggest an autoimmune origin.\nbackground: neuromuscular symptoms in patients with lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome (lems) and a small cell lung cancer (sclc) develop more rapidly than in lems patients without a sclc.\nthe detection of sox1 antibodies in patients with lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome (lems) predicts the presence of small cell lung cancer and may be used to follow more closely those lems patients with no evidence of cancer at the initial workup.\nthe presence of a particular symptom associated with lems did not predict the presence of sclc, but in patients with rapidly progressive lems the possibility of underlying lung cancer should be of particular concern.\nwe report a case of small-cell lung cancer (sclc) presenting with lems and ventilatory failure in a 67-year-old man who initially presented with progressive limb weakness for 6 months and tachypnea with shallow breathing for 1 week.\nusing this protein, we demonstrated that anti-beta-subunit antibodies are present in the sera of 23% of lems patients and only, in low titer, in 2% of small cell lung cancer patients without lems.\nthe gene encoding the beta 2 protein, first described as a lambert-eaton myasthenic

lems patients' 25 with proven small cell lung cancer (sclc) and 66 healthy or other neurological, sclc or autoimmune disease controls in an immunoprecipitation assay using 125i-omega-cmtx-labelled (p/q-type) vgccs in human cerebellar extract.\nin the majority of patients lems is associated with small cell lung cancer (sclc).\npatients with small cell lung cancer (sclc) in particular may develop lems, and sclc is very often detected in patients affected by lems.\nwe present a 69-year-old woman who had preventive whole brain radiation after a diagnosis of paraneoplastic lambert-eaton syndrome

GINS is also important for the normal progression of DNA replication forks, and we show that it is required after initiation to maintain the association between MCM and Cdc45 within RPCs\nWe found previously that many regulatory proteins assemble around the MCM2-7 helicase at yeast replication forks to form the replisome progression complex (RPC), which might link MCM2-7 to other replisome components.\nHere we show that SCF(Dia2) associates with the replisome progression complex (RPC) that assembles around the MCM2-7 helicase at DNA replication forks [6].\nCompared with wild type, hydroxyurea-treated ctf18\u0436\u0434 cells exhibited increased chromatin association of replisome progression complex components including Cdc45, Ctf4, and GINS complex subunits, the polymerase processivity clamp PCNA and the single-stranded DNA-binding complex RPA.\nThe amino-terminal TPR domain of Dia2 tethers SCF(Dia2) to the replisome progression complex.\nCtf4 is a protein conserved in eukaryotes and a constituent of the replisome progression complex.\nEukaryotic GINS also links with other key proteins at the fork to maintain an active replisome progression complex.\nDia2 has previously been implicated in the control of replication and genome stability via its interaction with the replisome progression complex.\nThe Cdc45-MCM-GINS complex could constitute the core of a larger macromolecular structure that has been termed the \"replisome progression complex\".\nFACT does not associate with the Mcm2-7 helicase at replication origins during G1 phase but is subsequently incorporated into the replisome progression complex independently of histone binding and uniquely among histone chaperones.\nOur data indicate that a complex of the GINS and Ctf4 components of the RPC is crucial to couple MCM2-7 to DNA polymerase alpha.\nReplisome progression complex links DNA replication to sister chromatid cohesion in Xenopus egg extracts.\nOn the basis of the physical interactions between AND-1 and DNA polymerases, we discuss a model to describe how replisome progression complex establishes sister chromatid cohesion.\nThe components of the replisome that preserve genomic stability by controlling the progression of eukaryotic DNA replication forks are poorly understood.\nRPC components include the essential initiation and elongation factor, Cdc45, the checkpoint mediator Mrc1, the Tof1-Csm3 complex that allows replication forks to pause at protein-DNA barriers, the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) and Ctf4, which helps to establish sister chromatid cohesion.",

Phenotypic features of GOSHS in this inbred family included microcephaly and mental retardation, which are both central nervous system defects, as well as Hirschsprung disease, an enteric nervous system defect\nWe demonstrate that homozygous nonsense mutations in KIAA1279 at 10q22.1, encoding a protein with two tetratrico peptide repeats, underlie this syndromic form of Hirschsprung disease and generalized polymicrogyria, establishing the importance of KIAA1279 in both enteric and central nervous system development\nWe report on four children in whom was diagnosed a neurocristopathy, associating Hirschsprung's disease with a wide spectrum of neurologic abnormalities. The patients included two children presenting the phenotypic features of the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome: distinct dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, and mental retardation, along with agenesis of the corpus callosum and cortical malformations associated with intractable seizures in one child. The third newborn presented with the Haddad syndrome: short-segment Hirschsprung's disease associated with the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome requiring permanent artificial ventilation\nTherefore, awareness of a possible neurocristopathy associated with neurologic abnormalities should be taken into account in any patient newly diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease to detect the abnormalities early and promptly manage them",

          "context": "5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-cdr), a nucleoside analog that can inhibit dna cytosine methylation, possesses potent antitumorigenic activities for myeloid disorders. although 5-aza-cdr is known to be incorporated into dna and inhibit dna (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear.\nthe mechanism of inhibition of dna (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by 5-azacytosine is likely to involve methyl transfer to the inhibitor.\nthe mechanism of inhibition of dna (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by the mechanism-based inhibitor 5-azacytosine has remained unclear, mainly because of the unavailability of a substrate in which the inhibitor, but not normal cytosine, is present at the target site.\nthese results suggest that, when the enzyme binds to 5-azacytosine in the presence of the cofactor, a methyl group is transferred to the n-5 position of the base, resulting in the inactivation of the enzyme.\nrapid synthesis of new dnmt inhibitors derivatives of procainamide.\nsix compounds resulted in potent inhibitors of the murine catalytic dnmt3a/3l complex and of human dnmt1, at least 50 times greater than that of the parent compounds. the inhibitors showed selectivity for c5 dna methyltransferases.\ndna (cytosine-c5) methyltransferase inhibition by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 2-(1h)-pyrimidinone (zebularine aglycon) at the enzymatic target site.\na number of dna methyltransferase inhibitors are known to reactivate silenced genes; including 5-azacytidine and 2-(1h)-pyrimidinone riboside (zebularine). zebularine is a more stable, less cytotoxic inhibitor compared to 5-azacytidine.\nodns containing 2-(1h)-pyrimidinone at the enzymatic target site are competitive inhibitors of both prokaryotic and mammalian dna c5 methyltransferases. we determined that the ternary complexes between the enzymes, 2-(1h)-pyrimidinone inhibitor, and the cofactor s-adenosyl methionine are maintained through the formation of a reversible covalent interaction. the differing stability and reversibility of the covalent bonds may partially account for the observed differences in cytotoxicity between zebularine and 5-azacytidine inhibitors.\ndna methyltransferases (dnmts) are a family of enzymes that methylate dna at the c5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers.\nthe inhibitory activity of hydralazine toward dnmt may be rationalized at the molecular level by similar interactions within the binding pocket (e.g., by a similar pharmacophore) as established by substrate-like deoxycytidine analogues.\ndespite the different scaffolds of other non-nucleoside dnmt inhibitors such as procaine and procainamide, the current modeling work reveals that these drugs exhibit similar interactions within the dnmt1 binding site. these findings are valuable in guiding the rational design and virtual screening of novel dnmt inhibitors.\ninhibition of hhai dna (cytosine-c5) methyltransferase by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine: examination of the intertwined roles of co-factor, target, transition state structure and enzyme conformation.\nthe presence of 5-azacytosine (zcyt) residues in dna leads to potent inhibition of dna (cytosine-c5) methyltranferases (c5-mtases) in vivo and in vitro.\nthus, it is important to understand the critical mechanistic determinants of zcyt's inhibitory action.\nsince methyl transfer can occur only in the presence of adomet, these results suggest (1) that the inhibitory capacity of zcyt in dna is based on its ability to induce a stable, tightly closed conformation of m.hhai that prevents dna and co-factor release and (2) that methylation of zcyt in dna is not required for inhibition of m.hhai.\nzebularine: a novel dna methylation inhibitor that forms a covalent complex with dna methyltransferases.\nthe inhibition of cytosine-[c5]-specific dna methyltransferases (c5 mtases) by oligodeoxynucleotides containing 5-azadeoxycytidine (azadc) and 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (fdc) provides a well-documented example of mechanism-based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism.\nsynthesis of oligonucleotide inhibitors of dna (cytosine-c5) methyltransferase containing 5-azacytosine residues at specific sites.\nthe incorporation of 5-azacytosine residues into dna causes potent inhibition of dna (cytosine-c5) methyltransferases. t\nmechanism of inhibition of dna (cytosine c5)-methyltransferases by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine.\nsubstitution of dzcyt for target cytosines in c-g dinucleotides of single-stranded or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates led to complete inhibition of methylation by murine dna c5-mtase.\noligodeoxyribonucleotides containing dzcyt formed a tight but reversible complex with m.hhai, and were consistently more potent as inhibitors of dna methylation than oligodeoxyribonucleotides identical in sequence containing 5-fluorocytosine.\nthese results indicate that dzcyt can occupy the active site of m.hhai as a transition state mimic and, because of the high degree of affinity of its interaction with the enzyme, it can act as a potent inhibitor of methylation.\nanalysis of dna methylation processes related to the inhibition of dna synthesis by 5-azacytidine in streptomyces antibioticus eth 7451.\nour results suggest that some of the 5-azacytidine effects on dna and rna synthesis might indeed be related to the complex formation and inhibition of a cytosine-specific dna methyltransferase.\ndna containing 4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine inhibits methylation by hhai methyltransferase.\nthe inhibitory effect of the 4'sulfur atom on enzymatic activity may be traced to perturbation of a step in the methylation reaction after dna binding but prior to methyl transfer.\ntreatment of schizosaccharomyces pombe with the c5 dna methyltransferase (c5mtase) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-azac) has previously been shown to induce g2 checkpoint-dependent cell cycle arrest.\ninhibitors of dna methyltransferase (dnmt) enzymes have been advocated as a means to promote and stabilize foxp3 expression in tregs undergoing expansion in vitro before their injection in vivo.\nbooster of pluripotency: rsc133, a new synthetic derivative of indoleacrylic acid/indolepropionic acid, exhibits dual activity by inhibiting histone deacetylase and dna methyltransferase.\ndna methyltransferase inhibitors (dnmtis), including decitabine (dac) and azacitidine (aza), have recently been highlighted for the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (mds); however, their action mechanisms have not been clearly defined.\nstructurally, however, gemcitabine has similarities to             5-aza-2-deoxycytidine

mir-146a expression.\ndiverse dna methyltransferase inhibitors are being studied as potential anticancer drugs, and there is interest in developing novel and more effective dnmtis.\ncurrently, there are only a few dnmt1 inhibitors with potential application as therapeutic agents or research tools.\nthe effects of the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), which depletes dna

          "context_original_capitalization": "5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), a nucleoside analog that can inhibit DNA cytosine methylation, possesses potent antitumorigenic activities for myeloid disorders. Although 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear.\nThe mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by 5-azacytosine is likely to involve methyl transfer to the inhibitor.\nThe mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by the mechanism-based inhibitor 5-azacytosine has remained unclear, mainly because of the unavailability of a substrate in which the inhibitor, but not normal cytosine, is present at the target site.\nThese results suggest that, when the enzyme binds to 5-azacytosine in the presence of the cofactor, a methyl group is transferred to the N-5 position of the base, resulting in the inactivation of the enzyme.\nRapid synthesis of new DNMT inhibitors derivatives of procainamide.\nSix compounds resulted in potent inhibitors of the murine catalytic Dnmt3A/3L complex and of human DNMT1, at least 50 times greater than that of the parent compounds. The inhibitors showed selectivity for C5 DNA methyltransferases.\nDNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase inhibition by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone (zebularine aglycon) at the enzymatic target site.\nA number of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are known to reactivate silenced genes; including 5-azacytidine and 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside (zebularine). Zebularine is a more stable, less cytotoxic inhibitor compared to 5-azacytidine.\nODNs containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone at the enzymatic target site are competitive inhibitors of both prokaryotic and mammalian DNA C5 methyltransferases. We determined that the ternary complexes between the enzymes, 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone inhibitor, and the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine are maintained through the formation of a reversible covalent interaction. The differing stability and reversibility of the covalent bonds may partially account for the observed differences in cytotoxicity between zebularine and 5-azacytidine inhibitors.\nDNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers.\nThe inhibitory activity of hydralazine toward DNMT may be rationalized at the molecular level by similar interactions within the binding pocket (e.g., by a similar pharmacophore) as established by substrate-like deoxycytidine analogues.\nDespite the different scaffolds of other non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors such as procaine and procainamide, the current modeling work reveals that these drugs exhibit similar interactions within the DNMT1 binding site. These findings are valuable in guiding the rational design and virtual screening of novel DNMT inhibitors.\nInhibition of HhaI DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine: examination of the intertwined roles of co-factor, target, transition state structure and enzyme conformation.\nThe presence of 5-azacytosine (ZCyt) residues in DNA leads to potent inhibition of DNA (cytosine-C5) methyltranferases (C5-MTases) in vivo and in vitro.\nThus, it is important to understand the critical mechanistic determinants of ZCyt's inhibitory action.\nSince methyl transfer can occur only in the presence of AdoMet, these results suggest (1) that the inhibitory capacity of ZCyt in DNA is based on its ability to induce a stable, tightly closed conformation of M.HhaI that prevents DNA and co-factor release and (2) that methylation of ZCyt in DNA is not required for inhibition of M.HhaI.\nZebularine: a novel DNA methylation inhibitor that forms a covalent complex with DNA methyltransferases.\nThe inhibition of cytosine-[C5]-specific DNA methyltransferases (C5 MTases) by oligodeoxynucleotides containing 5-azadeoxycytidine (AzadC) and 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC) provides a well-documented example of mechanism-based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism.\nSynthesis of oligonucleotide inhibitors of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase containing 5-azacytosine residues at specific sites.\nThe incorporation of 5-azacytosine residues into DNA causes potent inhibition of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferases. T\nMechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine C5)-methyltransferases by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine.\nSubstitution of DZCyt for target cytosines in C-G dinucleotides of single-stranded or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates led to complete inhibition of methylation by murine DNA C5-MTase.\nOligodeoxyribonucleotides containing DZCyt formed a tight but reversible complex with M.HhaI, and were consistently more potent as inhibitors of DNA methylation than oligodeoxyribonucleotides identical in sequence containing 5-fluorocytosine.\nThese results indicate that DZCyt can occupy the active site of M.HhaI as a transition state mimic and, because of the high degree of affinity of its interaction with the enzyme, it can act as a potent inhibitor of methylation.\nAnalysis of DNA methylation processes related to the inhibition of DNA synthesis by 5-azacytidine in Streptomyces antibioticus ETH 7451.\nOur results suggest that some of the 5-azacytidine effects on DNA and RNA synthesis might indeed be related to the complex formation and inhibition of a cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase.\nDNA containing 4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine inhibits methylation by HhaI methyltransferase.\nThe inhibitory effect of the 4'sulfur atom on enzymatic activity may be traced to perturbation of a step in the methylation reaction after DNA binding but prior to methyl transfer.\nTreatment of Schizosaccharomyces pombe with the C5 DNA methyltransferase (C5Mtase) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) has previously been shown to induce G2 checkpoint-dependent cell cycle arrest.\nInhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) enzymes have been advocated as a means to promote and stabilize Foxp3 expression in Tregs undergoing expansion in vitro before their injection in vivo.\nBooster of pluripotency: RSC133, a new synthetic derivative of indoleacrylic acid/indolepropionic acid, exhibits dual activity by inhibiting histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase.\nDNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs), including decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA), have recently been highlighted for the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); however, their action mechanisms have not been clearly defined.\nStructurally, however, gemcitabine has similarities to             5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine/Dacogen\u00ae), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor             (DNMTi).\nAlthough 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear.\nHuman colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT29, SW48, SW480) were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, followed by trichostatin A (TSA), as a histone deacetylase inhibitor.\nWith increasing 5-Aza-CdR concentrations, the expression of DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner.\nPsammaplin A (11c) is a marine metabolite previously reported to be a potent inhibitor of two classes of epigenetic enzymes: histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases.\nDefining the parameters of zebularine-mediated tumor inhibition may advance the future development of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as an effective cancer treatment.\nThe DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor [trichostatin A (TSA)] both significantly up-regulated miR-146a transcriptional activation by altering the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB in macrophages isolated from aged mice, which suggests that DNA methylation and histone acetylation are involved in the suppression of age-dependent miR-146a expression.\nDiverse DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are being studied as potential anticancer drugs, and there is interest in developing novel and more effective DNMTIs.\nCurrently, there are only a few DNMT1 inhibitors with potential application as therapeutic agents or research tools.\nThe effects of the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), which depletes DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1), on melanoma differentiation were examined.\nCooperative action of HDACi and DNA methylation inhibitors (DNMTi) has been reported, making combined treatment an attractive choice for cancer therapy.",

frequently prescribed substances. sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram were also prescribed. conclusion: a reserved medical treatment can be observed in child and adolescence psychiatry. off-label use seems to be nearly unavoidable due to the lack of newly authorized medicine. moreover, the numerous prescriptions for fluoxetine, the only ssri currently approved for this age group in germany, lead to the question of possible unauthorized alternatives.\npremature ejaculation (pe) is a common sexual dysfunction affecting 20% to 30% of men worldwide\ntreatment of pe typically involves pharmacotherapy, particularly when lifelong. although there are numerous reports on the off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and other compounds, only 2 treatments have been evaluated in randomized controlled phase 3 clinical trials: psd502 and dapoxetine (ssri)\ndrug therapy of fibromyalgia syndrome. systematic review, meta-analysis and guideline].\namitriptyline and-in case of comorbid depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder-duloxetine are recommended. off-label use of duloxetine and pregabalin can be considered in case of no comorbid mental disorder.\ntrazodone is an antidepressant belonging to the class of serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors. it is approved by the fda for the treatment of depression. insomnia is the most frequent reason for prescription of trazodone. it has also been proven useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders. other off-label uses include the treatment of bulimia, benzodiazepine/alcohol dependence, fibromyalgia, central nervous system degenerative diseases (behavioral disorders in dementia and other organic disorders), schizophrenia, chronic pain disease and diabetic neuropathy, sexual dysfunction.\nsymptoms of vasomotor dysregulation (hot flashes) associated with the menopausal transition and sex hormone deprivation. implication of changes in central neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of hot flashes has prompted the off-label use of serotonergic and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-ergic drugs as a therapeutic alternative,\nsertraline was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of major depressive disorder, followed by fluvoxamine and tianeptine. fluvoxamine was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of anxiety disorders and mixed disorders of emotions and conduct. off-label prescribing of antidepressants was found in 85.6% of young patients.\nour results suggest that duloxetine is a possible alternative treatment of postprostatectomy established stress urinary incontinence.\npharmacological treatment of fibromyalgia.\ndifferent classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic antidepressants (tcas), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)\ngynaecological cancer patients generally suffer from an earlier and more severe menopausal syndrome than the general female population. hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and there are non-hormonal treatments that are proven to be more effective than placebo in randomized controlled trials, e.g., some antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine. the main limits to the use of these drugs in controlling hot flashes are the off-label use for this purpose,\nymptomatic therapy for patients with erectile dysfunction.\na oral daily off label use therapy with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline) can be offered.\nwithout the food and drug administration approval, dapoxetine, as well as other ssris in pe, is an off-label drug for pe.\nthe treatment of pe consists of primarily off-label use of oral selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) via either on-demand or daily delivery. \nthe results of this off-label use show that duloxetine is effective in men with sui after prostate surgery even if standard pelvic floor exercises have failed.\npreliminary results on the off-label use of duloxetine for the treatment of stress incontinence after radical prostatectomy or cystectomy.\nthe number of children and adolescents whose visits involved prescription of antidepressants, particularly ssris, has increased markedly through 2002. although fluoxetine remained the most commonly prescribed, other ssris were increasingly prescribed through 2002. these trends raise concerns regarding the widespread off-label use of antidepressants lacking reliable evidence of safety and efficacy for use in children and adolescents.\ngiven the presumed efficacy of these new compounds and the off-label use of the current ssris, one might conclude that psychotherapy\\behavior therapy for rapid ejaculation is an obsolete and antiquated intervention\nthe use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and breast-feeding:\nthe use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy or lactation is, to date, not

          "context_original_capitalization": "The present analysis evaluates the prevalence and medication use in inpatients with depression during childhood and adolescence\nFluoxetine and mirtazapine were the most frequently prescribed substances. Sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram were also prescribed. CONCLUSION: A reserved medical treatment can be observed in child and adolescence psychiatry. Off-label use seems to be nearly unavoidable due to the lack of newly authorized medicine. Moreover, the numerous prescriptions for fluoxetine, the only SSRI currently approved for this age group in Germany, lead to the question of possible unauthorized alternatives.\nPremature ejaculation (PE) is a common sexual dysfunction affecting 20% to 30% of men worldwide\nTreatment of PE typically involves pharmacotherapy, particularly when lifelong. Although there are numerous reports on the off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other compounds, only 2 treatments have been evaluated in randomized controlled phase 3 clinical trials: PSD502 and dapoxetine (SSRI)\nDrug therapy of fibromyalgia syndrome. Systematic review, meta-analysis and guideline].\nAmitriptyline and-in case of comorbid depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder-duloxetine are recommended. Off-label use of duloxetine and pregabalin can be considered in case of no comorbid mental disorder.\nTrazodone is an antidepressant belonging to the class of serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors. It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of depression. Insomnia is the most frequent reason for prescription of trazodone. It has also been proven useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Other off-label uses include the treatment of bulimia, benzodiazepine/alcohol dependence, fibromyalgia, central nervous system degenerative diseases (behavioral disorders in dementia and other organic disorders), schizophrenia, chronic pain disease and diabetic neuropathy, sexual dysfunction.\nsymptoms of vasomotor dysregulation (hot flashes) associated with the menopausal transition and sex hormone deprivation. Implication of changes in central neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of hot flashes has prompted the off-label use of serotonergic and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-ergic drugs as a therapeutic alternative,\nSertraline was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of major depressive disorder, followed by fluvoxamine and tianeptine. Fluvoxamine was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of anxiety disorders and mixed disorders of emotions and conduct. Off-label prescribing of antidepressants was found in 85.6% of young patients.\nOur results suggest that duloxetine is a possible alternative treatment of postprostatectomy established stress urinary incontinence.\nPharmacological treatment of fibromyalgia.\ndifferent classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\nGynaecological cancer patients generally suffer from an earlier and more severe menopausal syndrome than the general female population. Hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and there are non-hormonal treatments that are proven to be more effective than placebo in randomized controlled trials, e.g., some antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine. The main limits to the use of these drugs in controlling hot flashes are the off-label use for this purpose,\nymptomatic therapy for patients with erectile dysfunction.\na oral daily off label use therapy with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline) can be offered.\nWithout the Food and Drug Administration approval, dapoxetine, as well as other SSRIs in PE, is an off-label drug for PE.\nthe treatment of PE consists of primarily off-label use of oral selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) via either on-demand or daily delivery. \nThe results of this off-label use show that Duloxetine is effective in men with SUI after prostate surgery even if standard pelvic floor exercises have failed.\nPreliminary results on the off-label use of duloxetine for the treatment of stress incontinence after radical prostatectomy or cystectomy.\nthe number of children and adolescents whose visits involved prescription of antidepressants, particularly SSRIs, has increased markedly through 2002. Although fluoxetine remained the most commonly prescribed, other SSRIs were increasingly prescribed through 2002. These trends raise concerns regarding the widespread off-label use of antidepressants lacking reliable evidence of safety and efficacy for use in children and adolescents.\nGiven the presumed efficacy of these new compounds and the off-label use of the current SSRIs, one might conclude that psychotherapy\\behavior therapy for rapid ejaculation is an obsolete and antiquated intervention\nThe use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and breast-feeding:\nThe use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy or lactation is, to date, not promoted because of lack of safety documentation. However, the off-label use of these drugs has been common for several years. In the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders during pregnancy, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often preferred over tricyclic antidepressants because of their relatively few adverse effects and safety in overdose. \nThe last few years have seen a remarkable rise in the off-label use of trazodone for inducing sleep in nondepressed patients, to a degree that it is prescribed for this purpose as commonly as the leading hypnotic\nSince the mid-1980s there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia.",
