"""Module for constructing a linear-chain CRF.
The following snippet is an example of a CRF layer on top of a batched sequence
of unary scores (logits for every word). This example also decodes the most
likely sequence at test time:
log_likelihood, transition_params = tf.contrib.crf.crf_log_likelihood(
    unary_scores, gold_tags, sequence_lengths)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(-log_likelihood)
train_op = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01).minimize(loss)
tf_unary_scores, tf_sequence_lengths, tf_transition_params, _ = session.run(
    [unary_scores, sequence_lengths, transition_params, train_op])
for tf_unary_scores_, tf_sequence_length_ in zip(tf_unary_scores,
                                                 tf_sequence_lengths):
# Remove padding.
tf_unary_scores_ = tf_unary_scores_[:tf_sequence_length_]
# Compute the highest score and its tag sequence.
viterbi_sequence, viterbi_score = tf.contrib.crf.viterbi_decode(
    tf_unary_scores_, tf_transition_params)

    """Computes log(sum(exp(elements across dimensions of a tensor))).
    Reduces `input_tensor` along the dimensions given in `reduction_indices`.
    Unless `keep_dims` is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each
    entry in `reduction_indices`. If `keep_dims` is true, the reduced dimensions
    are retained with length 1.
    If `reduction_indices` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and a
    tensor with a single element is returned.
    This funciton is more numerically stable than log(sum(exp(input))). It avoids
    overflows caused by taking the exp of large inputs and underflows caused by
    taking the log of small inputs.
    For example:
    ```python
    # 'x' is [[0, 0, 0]]
    #         [0, 0, 0]]
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x) ==> log(6)
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x, 0) ==> [log(2), log(2), log(2)]
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x, 1) ==> [log(3), log(3)]
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x, 1, keep_dims=True) ==> [[log(3)], [log(3)]]
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x, [0, 1]) ==> log(6)
    ```
    Args:
      input_tensor: The tensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.
      reduction_indices: The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the defaut),
